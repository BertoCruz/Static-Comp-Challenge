# STATIC COMP CHALLENGE

## Abstract
- The static comp challenge is a challenge to work out my HTML/CSS muscles. Below is the original comp I will attemp to re recreate, followed by my finish product. I believe that once I get into the workforce I will be presented with requirements to  build out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail.
